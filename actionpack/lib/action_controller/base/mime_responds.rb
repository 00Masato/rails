module ActionController #:nodoc:
  module MimeResponds #:nodoc:

    # Without web-service support, an action which collects the data for displaying a list of people
    # might look something like this:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #   end
    #
    # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html
    #       format.xml { render :xml => @people.to_xml }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # What that says is, "if the client wants HTML in response to this action, just respond as we
    # would have before, but if the client wants XML, return them the list of people in XML format."
    # (Rails determines the desired response format from the HTTP Accept header submitted by the client.)
    #
    # Supposing you have an action that adds a new person, optionally creating their company
    # (by name) if it does not already exist, without web-services, it might look like this:
    #
    #   def create
    #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(params[:company][:name])
    #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
    #
    #     redirect_to(person_list_url)
    #   end
    #
    # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
    #
    #   def create
    #     company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
    #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
    #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html { redirect_to(person_list_url) }
    #       format.js
    #       format.xml  { render :xml => @person.to_xml(:include => @company) }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If the client wants HTML, we just redirect them back to the person list. If they want Javascript
    # (format.js), then it is an RJS request and we render the RJS template associated with this action.
    # Lastly, if the client wants XML, we render the created person as XML, but with a twist: we also
    # include the person's company in the rendered XML, so you get something like this:
    #
    #   <person>
    #     <id>...</id>
    #     ...
    #     <company>
    #       <id>...</id>
    #       <name>...</name>
    #       ...
    #     </company>
    #   </person>
    #
    # Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:
    #
    #   company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
    #   @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
    #
    # This is because the incoming XML document (if a web-service request is in process) can only contain a
    # single root-node. So, we have to rearrange things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):
    #
    #   person[name]=...&person[company][name]=...&...
    #
    # And, like this (xml-encoded):
    #
    #   <person>
    #     <name>...</name>
    #     <company>
    #       <name>...</name>
    #     </company>
    #   </person>
    #
    # In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single entity's person. Then, in the action,
    # we extract the company data from the request, find or create the company, and then create the new person
    # with the remaining data.
    #
    # Note that you can define your own XML parameter parser which would allow you to describe multiple entities
    # in a single request (i.e., by wrapping them all in a single root node), but if you just go with the flow
    # and accept Rails' defaults, life will be much easier.
    #
    # If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can register your own handlers in
    # environment.rb as follows.
    #
    #   Mime::Type.register "image/jpg", :jpg
