ActiveRelation is a Relational Algebra for Ruby. It simplifies both the simplest and the most complex of SQL queries and it transparently adapts to various RDBMS systems. It is intended to be a framework framework; that is, you can build your own ORM with it, focusing on what makes your ORM different. It can also be used for in-memory relational modeling and querying, independent of a database.
