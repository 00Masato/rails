<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Benchmarking and Profiling is an important part of the development process that is not nearly enough talked about for  beginning developers. Its hard enough learning a language and successfully writing an application. But without a firm understanding optimization, production ready apps are a near impossibility. No matter how well you code, or how much you know about a language there is always something that will trip up your application.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This article is my attempt to give the basic knowledge and methodology needed to optimize your application as painlessly as possible. We are are attempting this on two fronts. Both as a straight explanation and also through a real example of how benchmarking can speed up an application.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>There are a lot of areas we need to cover so lets start.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="_terminology">Terminology</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="_what_we_mean_by_benchmarking_and_profiling">What We Mean by Benchmarking and Profiling</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Benchmarking: If you are new to programing you probably have heard the term mostly in comparative reviews of computer and graphic card specs. If you done a bit of coding you've probably seen in mostly in terms of comparing one language to another or iterations of the same language.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Benchmarking in rails is more fine grained. It entails comparing and contrasting various parts and pages of an application against one another. Mostly one is looking for how long a page requires to render, but memory consumption is also an area of concern.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>While benchmarking two different sets of problems can emerge. Either you find that a few pages are performing worse then the rest of your app unexpectedly or that your whole entire application is slower then it reasonably should be. From there you start to profile to find the problem.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Profiling: When a page or process is seen to be problematic due to speed or memory consumption we profile it. Meaning we measures the behavior as the page or process runs, particularly the frequency and duration of function calls. The goal of profiling is not to find bugs, but to eliminate bottlenecks and establish a baseline for future regression testing. It must be engaged in a carefully controlled process of measurement and analysis.</p></div>
<h4 id="_what_does_that_actually_mean">What does that actually mean?</h4>
<div class="para"><p>You have to have a clear goal for when you benchmark and profile. It's very comparable to BDD where you are taking small steps towards a solution instead of trying to do it all in one large all encompassing step. A clearly defined set of expectations is essential for meaningful performance testing. We will talk more about this later.</p></div>
<h4 id="_where_does_this_leave_us">Where Does this Leave Us</h4>
<div class="para"><p>Numbers and data. You benchmark to compare, your profile to fix. It's all about gaining data to analyze and using that information to better your application. The most important thing you should take away at the moment that this must be done in a systematic way.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>So the next logical question is how do we get this data.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_on_the_road_to_optimization">On The Road to Optimization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="_looking_at_the_log_file_in_regards_to_optimization">Looking at the log file in regards to optimization</h3>

<div class="content">
<pre><tt>You actually have been gathering data for benchmarking throughout your development cycle. Your log files are not just for error detection they also contain very useful information on how speedy your action is behaving.</tt></pre>

</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>What concerns us here is the last line of the action.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Completed in 0.04310 (23 reqs/sec) gives us the amount of requests this specific action can handle.  0.04310 is the total amount of time the process to complete and 23 reqs/sec is an estimation from this. As we will see this number is not strictly valid since is a single instance of the process. But it does give you a general feel as to how the action is performing.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Rendering: 0.00819 (19%)  is the amount in milliseconds and the percentage of total time needed to complete the action for rendering the view</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>DB: 0.00757 (17%) is the amount in milliseconds and the percentage of total time needed to complete the action for querying the database</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Pretty easy right. But wait 17+19 equals 36. 36%! where  is the rest of the time going?  The rest of the time is being spent processing the controller. It is not shown but it is easy to calculate. Usually there is where most of your time ends on well functions actions.</p></div>
<h3 id="_why_the_log_file_on_it_s_own_is_not_helpful">Why the Log File on it's Own is not Helpful</h3>
<div class="para"><p>So why can't we just use this to test our rails application. Technically that could work, but would be very stressful and slow. You don't have time to view your log after every request to see if your code is running quickly. Also a request that runs 100 reqs/sec might simply be an outlier and really usually runs at 20 reqs/sec. It's simply not enough information to do everything we need it to do but it's a start.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>But there is something else we must consider.</p></div>
<h3 id="_a_simple_question_a_complicated_answer">A Simple Question, a Complicated Answer</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Is Completed in 0.04310 (23 reqs/sec) a good time. Seems like it doesn't it. 43 ms does not outrageous time for a dynamic page load. But is this a dynamic page load. Maybe it was all cached. In which case this is very slow. Or maybe I'm running on five year old equipment and this is actually blazing fast for my G3.  The truth is that we can't answer the question given the data. This is part of benchmarking. We need a baseline. Through comparative analysis of all your pages in your app, and an simple dynamic page for a control we can determine how fast your pages are actually running and if any of them need to be optimized.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>And now for something completely different a  short statistic lesson.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_a_lession_in_statistics">A Lession In Statistics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Adapted from a blog Article by Zed Shaw. His rant is funnier but will take longer to read. &lt;br /&gt; <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/programmer_stats.html">Programmers Need To Learn Statistics Or I Will Kill Them All</a></p></div>
<h3 id="_why_learn_statistics">Why Learn Statistics</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Statistics is a hard discipline. One can study it for years without fully grasping all the complexities. But its a necessary evil for coders of every level to at least know the basics. You can't optimize without it, and if you use it wrong, you'll just waste your time and the rest of your team's.</p></div>
<h3 id="_power_of_ten_syndrome">Power-of-Ten Syndrome</h3>
<div class="para"><p>If you done any benchmarking you have probably heard
“All you need to do is run that test [insert power-of-ten] times and then do an average.”</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>For new developers this whole power of ten comes about because we need enough data to minimize the results being contaminated by outliers. If you loaded a page five times with three of those times being around 75ms and twice 250ms you have no way of knowing the real average processing time for you page. But if we take a 1000 times and 950 are 75ms and 50 are 250ms we have a much clearer picture of the situation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>But this still begs the question of how you determine that 1000 is the correct number of iterations to improve the power of the experiment? (Power in this context basically means the chance that your experiment is right.)</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The first thing that needs to be determined is how you are performing the samplings? 1000 iterations run in a massive sequential row? A set of 10 runs with 100 each? The statistics are different depending on which you do, but the 10 runs of 100 each would be a better approach. This lets you compare sample means and figure out if your repeated runs have any bias. More simply put, this allows you to see if you have a many or few outliers that might be poisoning your averages.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Another consideration is if a 1000 transactions is enough to get the process into a steady state after the ramp-up period? If you are benchmarking a long running process that stabilizes only after a warm-up time you must take that into consideration.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Also remember getting an average is not an end goal in itself. In fact in some cases they tell you almost nothing.</p></div>
<h3 id="_don_t_just_use_averages">Don't Just Use Averages!</h3>
<div class="para"><p>One cannot simply say my website “[insert power-of-ten] requests per second”. This is due to it being an Average. Without some form of range or variance error analysis it's a useless number.  Two averages can be the same, but hide massive differences in behavior. Without a standard deviation it’s not possible to figure out if the two might even be close.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Two averages can be the same say 30 requests a second and yet have a completely different standard deviation. Say the first sample has <tt>-3 and the second is </tt>-30</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Stability is vastly different for these two samples If this were a web server performance run I’d say the second server has a major reliability problem. No, it’s not going to crash, but it’s performance response is so erratic that you’d never know how long a request would take. Even though the two servers perform the same on average, users will think the second one is slower because of how it seems to randomly perform.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Another big thing to take into consideration when benchmarking and profiling is Confounding</p></div>
<h3 id="_confounding">Confounding</h3>
<div class="para"><p>The idea of confounding is pretty simple: If you want to measure something, then don’t measure anything else.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>#TODO add more information in how to avoid confounding.</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Your testing system and your production system must be separate. You can't profile on the same system because you are using resources to run the test that your server should be using to serve the requests.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>And one more thing.</p></div>
<h3 id="_define_what_you_are_measuring">Define what you are Measuring</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Before you can measure something you really need to lay down a very concrete definition of what you’re measuring. You should also try to measure the simplest thing you can and try to avoid confounding.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The most important thing to determine though is how much data you can actually send to your application through it's pipe.</p></div>
<h3 id="_back_to_business">Back to Business</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Now I know this was all a bit boring, but these fundamentals a necessary for understanding what we are actually doing here. Now onto the actual code and rails processes.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_performance_testing_built_into_rails">Performance Testing Built into Rails</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>As of June 20, 2008 edge rails has had a new type of Unit test geared towards profiling. Of course like most great things, getting it working takes  bit of work. The test relies on statistics gathered from the Garbage Collection that isn't readily available from standard compiled ruby. There is a patch located at <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/download.php/1814/7062/17676/3291/ruby186gc.patch">http://rubyforge.org/tracker/download.php/1814/7062/17676/3291/ruby186gc.patch</a></p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Also the test requires a new version of Ruby-Prof version of 0.6.1. It is not readily available at the moment and can most easily be found as a tarball on github. It's repository is located at git://github.com/jeremy/ruby-prof.git.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>What follows is a description of how to set up an alternative ruby install to use these features</p></div>

On running looking through my log files I find to my shock that the lowest time for a page run is running around 240 ms. My database finds aren't the problems so I'm lost as to what is happening to cause all this. Lets run a benchmark.</p></div>

From here I do a few more benchmarks to make sure that these processes are slowing down the other pages. They are so now I know what I must do. <strong>If we can get rid of or shorten these processes we can make our pages run much quicker</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Now both of these are main ruby processes so are goal right now is to find out what other process is calling them. Glancing at our Graph file I see that #cleanpath is calling #cleanpath_aggressive. #cleanpath is being called by String#gsub and from there some html template errors. But my page seems to be rendering fine. why would it be calling template errors. I'm decide to check my object flat file to see if I can find any more information.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>I’m going to give an example methodology for conducting your benchmarking and profiling on an application. It is based on your typical scientific method.</p></div>

</p>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Confounding: Test one thing at a time, keep everything the same so you don't poison the data with uncontrolled processes.
</p>
</li>

<p>
Cross Contamination: Make sure that runs from one test do not harm the other tests.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Steady States: If you’re testing long running process. You must take the ramp up time and performance hit into your initial measurements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sampling Error: Data should perform have a steady variance or range. If you get wild swings or sudden spikes, etc. then you must either account for the reason why or you have a sampling error.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Measurement Error: Aka Human error, always go through your calculations at least twice to make sure there are no mathematical errors. .
